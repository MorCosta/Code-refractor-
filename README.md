# Horiseon code refractor project.

## Description.
In this project, I worked to make the Horiseon page more accessible to all the users. I added descriptions to the pictures, that I also tested with a screen reader extension. I also edited the code to add the semantics html, and I edited and removed several css lines to make the code easier to navigate.

## Installation
Installation is not needed as the modification have already been implemented.

## Usage
It is possibile to easily scroll throught the page; otherwise it's possibile to click on one of the options in the navigation panel, and you'll be redirected to the interested parapgraph.
Also, with any screenreader, you'll be able to click on any section of the page, and the content of it will be read out loud. 
As you can see from the two screenshots below, you'll just need to enable a screen reader extension, and then you'll just need to click on the section that you'd like to be read.

## Credits
To test the pictures captions I used Screen reader by Google: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/screen-reader/kgejglhpjiefppelpmljglcjbhoiplfn
